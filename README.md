Capfolio, developed by WebZen, is a transformative platform that revolutionizes the computer science capstone course experience. It offers a comprehensive range of functionalities designed to enhance project showcasing and communication. With Capfolio, students can upload their capstone projects, including comprehensive details such as project titles, descriptions, images, YouTube videos, and GitHub repositories. These features allow students to accurately represent their work and attract the attention of potential employers and clients.

Furthermore, Capfolio provides a user-friendly interface for visitors, students, and administrators. Visitors have the option to create an account through a streamlined signup process or utilize Google OAuth for seamless sign-in. Students, particularly those affiliated with the University of Auckland, can log in directly using their university email addresses. The platform distinguishes between user types, granting specific privileges and access levels to guests, students, and administrators.

For administrators, Capfolio offers a robust admin panel that enables them to review and manage student projects. They have the authority to refine project details, assign awards to outstanding projects, and approve them for public display. This ensures the quality and appropriateness of showcased projects.

Overall, Capfolio empowers students to showcase their capstone projects to a global audience, facilitates direct communication and engagement with employers and clients, and provides administrators with effective project management tools. The platform's comprehensive functionalities and user-friendly interface make it an invaluable tool for bridging the gap between academia and industry, fostering meaningful connections, and propelling students' career opportunities in the field of computer science.
